# Automate_Recon
An automation tool for the begining of a PenTest.
The main goal behind this tool is to create and sum up all the basic tools we use to start a basic PenTest. 
Including: Gobuster,DnsRecon,Sublist3r,EyeWitness,nmap.
All are gathered into a final Tmux session in order to make life easier and see results upon running.
